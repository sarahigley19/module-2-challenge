# My Portfolio
This project is the beginnging staging of my web development portfoilo

##  Project Description
I used CSS and HTML to create the early start of my porfolio. This project was fun! I really enjoyed coming up with a design for this. I learned that starting with a mockup is SUPER helpful when it comes to web design. It is a lot easier to build something when you know what to build. I don't have any projects, so I wasn't able to link anything yet, but the space is ready and avaliable for it. 

The responive part of this project was hard. But I think I figured it out? At least good enough for now. I am excited to expand on knowledge with responsive design in the future.

One thing I was really proud of myself with this project was how much better I am at pushes. I think I have finally gotten down terminal. Yay!
